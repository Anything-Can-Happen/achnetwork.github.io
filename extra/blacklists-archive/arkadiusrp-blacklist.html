<h2>Arkadius Roleplay global blacklist</h2>
<h3>Arkadius has recived a global blacklist from the ACHNetwork Community. This all started from a community test after reciving some information that the community's staff doesn't follow it's own rules, not to mention that they cannot control their server. This as a community owner is the worst roleplay server i've ever been apart of. They decided to waste our time, failrp and get mad because we tried to help them.</h3>
<h2>You're required to leave this server.</h2>

<h5>Type: Network Blacklist, PERM & PUBLIC</h5>
<h5>Danger Level: Low Risk</h5>
