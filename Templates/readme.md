# What's this?
In an effort to minimize coding times our web devs can go here and grab a template to code off of. This makes it easier and it's a lot better than from scratch.

# Bootstrap & Tailwindcss (Currently used)
We currently use bootstrap and tailwindcss for web development, in html at least. We also use javascript but that's not important. The version of the framework will always be included (you can check by looking at the cdn file) if it's outdated fell free to upgrade it!
