# Global Network Rules
These rules apply to **ALL** servers in the ACHNetwork, whether you are a Network Partner or not. If your community is found breaking these rules ACHNetwork will investigate and find the needed punishment. Your community should never give people special treatment either.

1. Harrasment should not be allowed in your community
2. Do not share information about people within your community for any reason
3. Do not attack other communities
4. Do not copy communities, stay unique
