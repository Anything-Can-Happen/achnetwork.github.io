# Global Network Rules
These rules apply to **ALL** servers and users within ACHNetwork, whether you are a Network Partner or not. If your community is found breaking these rules ACHNetwork will investigate and find the needed punishment. Your community should never give people special treatment either.

# The Basics
Not Allowed: Harrasment, Sharing of Personal information, Attacking other communities (goes with the copying rule).
